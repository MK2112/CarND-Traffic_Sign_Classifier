## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I applied what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, I then tried out the model on images of German traffic signs that I randomly found on the web.

I also created a detailed [writeup](writeup.md) of the project.

To meet the project's specifications, three files were of outmost importance: 
* the [Ipython notebook](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) with the code
* the code exported as an [html file](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html)
* a [writeup](writeup.md) report either as a markdown or pdf file 

The Project
---
The achieved goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Loading the data set
* Exploring, summarizing and visualizing the data set
* Designing, training and testing a model architecture
* Using the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyzing the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarizing the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
